177,Cossacks II: Battle for Europe,Let the battle begin! The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe add-on continues the renowned Cossacks II:Napoleonic Wars game. It depicts the rather short historic period of the Napoleonic wars. The Napoleon wars changed Europe forever leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost one thousand years of constant strife between small states. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France Britain Austria Russia Prussia Egypt and three nations not represented in the original game - Spain the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and the Confederation of the Rhine.The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe reconstructs in detail the soldiers uniforms weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nations army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units 190 buildings and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account as was the value of formations provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An honest system of bullet and cannonball ballistics based on physics is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine. Other engine features include 3-dimensional landscaping which creates realistic-looking scenery and towns and impacts combat tactics. For example the firing range of a subdivision of soldiers or a cannon positioned at the top of a hill is greater than the firing range of a unitstationed on flat terrain. Key features:Control the French Russians Austrians Britons Prussians or Egyptians -- master new weapons and tactics during a time that redefined the meaning of modern warfare.Fight through historically inspired battles of the 19th century with massive armies colliding in different types of terrain and weather.Battles on real historical scale with tens of thausands of units on one map.Realistic Troop Morale System - Well-fed troops live longer and grow in experience to become valuable battlefield assets while fierce and overwhelming opponents or marching long distances will cause morale to dropEnhanced diplomacy tools help you create treaties that give you the advantages,English,Aug 26 2011,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447354584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/4890/header.jpg?t=1447354584,, ,4.99,4.99,0,223,1,0,0

Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents messages too (even if youre playing against bots cause bots are people too). New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch Capture the Flag Domination and Assault) the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. UBrowser - Unreal Tournaments robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. Its as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the Play Online button and then selecting a server from the list the game is on. Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler the camera can be attached to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way its a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. Its sorta like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.(c) 2000 Epic Games Inc.

595,Ceville,The mean cruel cold blooded tyrant Ceville ruthlessly rules the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis. Or rather he used to rule the beautiful kingdom of Faeryanis until the brave people revolted against his regime and drove him out of the palace.                     The kindhearted queen Gwendolyn did step up to reign over the land with a council of noble and wise advisors.. It seems that this story could end just like any other fairy tale: And they lived happily ever after... But no thats not quite right. Because another evil rises within the land. The treacherous Basilus �?counsellor of Gwendolyn and of Ceville before her �?plans to take the crown and torture the realm with the help of murderous beasts he has summoned from the planes of eternal darkness.                     All seems lost! But hope resides with the one most unlikely person imaginable to save the kingdom and restore peace to the realm: Ceville the realms former despotic ruler...                     Ceville                     The ancient ruler of Faeryanis and spare-time tyrant is dreaming up evil plans to exact his revenge on his former counsellor and servant Basilus who betrayed him.                    Ambrosius                     The noble and somewhat self-important knight Ambrosius is Cevilles would-be-nemesis. He constantly attempts to capture Ceville �?but usually with little success. Will they both team up to fight a greater evil?                     Lilly                     The gentle and kind girl Lilly is rather an improbable choice to team up with Ceville.

This game will give you an impression of what happens when you mix up the setting and humour of Shrek Discworld and the Monkey Island series.                                        up to three simultaniously playable characters with weird but loveable personalities                     bizarre characters from stock-broker dwarves and hippie-elves who populate the fairy-tale realm of Faeryanis                     various locations all over Faerynis like the Not-So-Hidden druid circle the (former) Elven Forest The Dwarven Mines of Mount Goldmore and more! a variety of puzzles many of which that can only be solved by teamwork of two (or more) player characters                     tons of humour,English German,Feb 27 2009,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/23460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1465907071,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/23460/header.jpg?t=1465907071,, ,9.99,9.99,0,0,1,0,0

609,Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come,It all happened in the darkest century of the medieval Europe when a visionary Pope ignited the flames of the first crusade and united the rivaling nations for one single cause: to conquer the Holy Land. Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come tells the challenging mission-to-mission story of this great campaign through the eye of a chosen knight and chronicles his struggles to rise higher among the ranks gaining power and wealth on the road from Constantinople to Jerusalem.Heroes -- Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come offers five notable personalities to choose from from the five great nations of medieval Europe each of them with different background wealth fighting skills goals and dreams. The gradual development of the focus character must be familiar from the RPGs: he gains experience ranks gets stronger and more effective. Each hero has a different set of skills which makes every hero different even the ones from the same nationality if one decides to play the game again from the very beginning. The different skills and starting resources of the five main heroes require various tactics in the battles and offer numerous ways to the final victory.Huge armies on huge battlefields -- Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come offers highly varied terrains that evoke the atmosphere of the faraway lands where the crusaders marched towards Jerusalem - from the Mediterranean pine forests to the barren rock deserts of the Holy Land. The topographic elements (hills valleys slopes etc) heavily influence the tactics and the outcome of the battles. It is also the first RTS where physics is one of the most important factors in the game (where rocks tumble down on the slopes crushing into the ranks of the enemy and send enemy soldiers flying and sprawling on the ground and so on.) Weather conditions and visibility change dynamically which is not solely a visual element but it also affects the gameplay specifically the abilities of the different units and the outcome of their actions. Management -- The Management phase is set between missions. The management screen offers various ways to manage the troops deal with supporting characters upgrade heroes spend the acquired ducats or distribute weaponry among the troops and assemble the army for the next battle. The growing army of the hero gets stronger and deadlier after each battle. Soldiers gain experience (just like in the legendary Panzers) and players buy skills for them as well. After several battles with the same old bands of soldiers players tend to treat their veterans more carefully then in most RTS games which has a strong impact on the tactics as well.Factions -- The crusader army in the game is about just as divided as it had been historically. The various power groups of the army are called factions each with a strong nation in charge and they all offer various submissions for their allies. Players should be careful which the faction they prefer as they forge ties with one nation they slowly exclude the others; however a faithful ally will get precious rewards like ducats special units and skills and finally a new unique hero.Faith and Relics -- In Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come Faith is an idealized concept of the religious background that sparked and legitimized the military campaign. Faith has strong impact on the overall morale. Christian relics have strong relations with the Faith score: the higher a heros Faith is the more effective these relics boost their abilities. Each hero starts with a unique Faith score that can grow or decrease during the game depending on his decisions.Historical Authenticity -- Crusaders: Thy Kingdom Come wants to be as faithful to the chosen historical era as it is possible in a computer game which requires some restrictions and necessary modifications. With  a colorful cast of supporting characters we present existing historical personalities from the era as antagonists allies or vassals.,English French German Italian Spanish,Oct 8 2009,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447352527,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/24410/header.jpg?t=1447352527,, ,9.99,9.99,0,0,1,0,0

From a house in the city journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess. In each world you have a different power to affect the way time behaves and it is times strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time behaviors include: the ability to rewind objects that are immune to being rewound time that is tied to space parallel realities time dilation and perhaps more.                     Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.                     Key features:                    Newly added Steam Cloud supportSave your in-progress game to the cloud then play where you left off from on any Steam connected computer.Forgiving yet challenging gameplay:                     Braid is a 2-D platform game where you can never die and never lose. Despite this Braid is challenging -- but the challenge is about solving puzzles rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.                    Rich puzzle environment:                     Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding creating parallel universes setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.                    Aesthetic design:                     A painterly art style and lush organic soundtrack complement the unique gameplay.                    Nonlinear story:                     A nonlinear fiction links the various worlds and provides real-world metaphors for your time manipulations; in turn your time manipulations are projections of the real-world themes into playful what-if universes where consequences can be explored.                    Nonlinear gameplay:                     The game doesnt force you to solve puzzles in order to proceed.

648,The Path,There is one rule in the game. And it needs to be broken.                    There is one goal. And when you attain it you die.                    Six sisters live in an apartment in the city. One by one their mother sends them on an errand to their grandmother who is sick and bedridden. The teenagers are instructed to go to grandmothers house deep in the forest and by all means to stay on the path! Wolves are hiding in the woods just waiting for little girls to stray.                     But young women are not exactly known for their obedience are they? Will they be able to resist the temptations of the forest? Will they stay clear of danger? Can they prevent the ancient tale from being retold?                    The Path is a game about growing about changing about making choices about accepting the consequences of these choices. A game about playing and failing about embracing life perhaps by accepting death.                    Key Features:                    The Path is a short horror game inspired by older versions of Little Red Riding hood set in modern day. The Path offers an atmospheric experience of exploration discovery and introspection through a unique form of gameplay designed to immerse you deeply into its dark themes. Every interaction in the game expresses an aspect of the narrative. The six protagonists each have their own age and personality and allow the player to live through the tale in different ways. Most of the story however relies on your active imagination.                    The Path is designed with accessibility in mind. There are no ticking clocks or monsters to defeat. No hard puzzles will ever halt your progress. Most activities in the game are entirely optional and voluntary. The player has all the freedom in the world to explore and experience.                    While The Path does not contain any graphic violence or sexuality it does allude to these themes. The overall melancholy mood of the game and the potentially unsettling course of events make The Path unsuitable for children. Despite of its origins in fairy tales The Path is decidedly a game for the mature mind.                    The game features a complete realtime 3D environment that can be explored through third person navigation. The characters in this virtual world including the players avatars are governed by a form of artificial intelligence that gives them some autonomy. As a result nobody knows exactly what you will encounter on your journeys.                    Next to the multi-layered stylized graphics The Path features a continuous soundtrack composed by goth rock diva Jarboe (ex-Swans). In fact there are hardly any sound effects in the game. Instead the music is continuously changing according to what is happening in the game. Like the behaviours of the characters the music too is never exactly the same twice.                    For a satisfying experience it takes about 6 hours to complete the game.,English Dutch Danish French German Hungarian Italian Portuguese Spanish,Mar 18 2009,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/27000/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447351736,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/27000/header.jpg?t=1447351736,, ,9.99,9.99,0,546,1,0,1

650,FATALE,Salome Salome dance for me. I pray thee dance for me. I am sad to-night. Yes I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I slipped in blood which is an evil omen; and I heard I am sure I heard in the air a beating of wings a beating of giant wings. I cannot tell what they mean .... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance for me. Dance for me Salome I beseech you. If you dance for me you may ask of me what you will and I will give it you even unto the half of my kingdom. Salome was a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. But it is Oscar Wildes 19th century play Salome that really inspired Fatale. In the Bible Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. In Wildes version Salome falls in love with the prophet. He rejects her and she has him executed. The play ends with her kissing the lips of his decapitated head.Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts.Explore a living tableau filled with references to the legendary tale of Salome and enjoy the moonlit serenity of a fatal night in the orient. Fatale offers an experimental play experience that stimulates the imagination and encourages multiple interpretations and personal associations. How to play Fatale:                    The Cistern: Think of Fatale as a role playing game. We will leave it to your imagination who you are playing. You find yourself in a prison. And the distant sound of music plays overhead.                     The Terrace: On the terrace your experience is disembodied.

CONTROL: Hold down the SPACEBAR to bring up the aureola. This is your inventory of scenes you can revisit and interact with. Click the letters to return to a still scene. If a space is blank clicking on it becomes a hint to where you should travel next.                    EXAMINE: The lights on the terrace invite you to hover over them to block them out. From scene to scene you have various options for interaction. Your cursor keys pan the view click & drag allows for camera rotation and sometimes rolling over or clicking items in these scenes can lead to surprising results.                     EXPLORE: Above all since this experience makes few demands take your time. Notice the small details. Listen to the whispers and echoes. Therein lies the joy. Allow yourself to fall in love with Salome now you have all the time in the world.The Dance: An epilogue which appears on restart after each complete playthrough.ESC: If you need help the ESC key leads you to a summary of context and controls.                    Fatale is played through first person 3D navigation but its controls may appear somewhat unconventional to the seasoned gamer. ASWD + mouselook navigation can be enabled in the Options menu.,English,Nov 4 2009,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/27050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447352658,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/27050/header.jpg?t=1447352658,, ,6.99,6.99,0,0,1,0,1

Their names were Overlord and Bagration.  Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory.

Tough capable deadly. As their motto goes Rangers lead the way!MERINOV - All-around hustler and opportunist who will jump at every chance to come out prosperous. Has no moral spine and is not to be taken lightly.DIAZ - Liaison for Langley on Operation Archangel in Sarajevo and Andersons partner. Though he can be haphazardly labeled as a desk jockey he has had extensive field training and is certainly more than meets the eye.MADDOX - Former US Delta Operator decorated for impeccable performance during 1991 Operation Desert Storm. A loose cannon who often compensates not having a sound game plan with an all-out adrenaline rush.About the GameSniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform first-person modern shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience. It takes the bulls-eye precision of its predecessor to new and exciting heights offering more diverse sniper challenges; a rebuilt AI system and the thrilling one shot one kill precision that made the original a huge hit selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the CryENGINE3 Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 also delivers striking graphic environments.Key FeaturesMotion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in real-world sniping in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the pads trigger so that when the round is fired the rifle is more accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off thus missing the target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the realism of its shooting dynamics.  Wind speed distance gravity and bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your round and the best snipers control both their heart and their head. From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull a sniper must pull together everything to achieve the ideal one shot; one kill.Improved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was completely re-tooled and designed from scratch.  Much of the improvements were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever. Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible to the widest group of gamers CI Games is introducing three difficulty levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to play - either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and experience the game on Expert Mode.Bullet-Cam: everyones favorite feature returns to reward expert shots and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the transfer of kinetic energy - a bullets true stopping power - can do to the enemy from 1000 meters or more!Bullet Penetration: concealment doesnt necessarily mean cover. In Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 bullets behave as they would in real life and are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an entire squad. Wait til you see that on Bullet Cam!Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the worlds most advanced sniper rifles each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately simulate the modern weaponry found on todays battlefields.New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night vision optics plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating the enemy before they spot you.,English* French German* Italian Spanish Polish Czech*languages with full audio support,Mar 11 2013,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/34870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447354965,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/34870/header.jpg?t=1447354965,, ,19.99,19.99,0,3682,1,0,0

874,Ninja Blade,It was July 7th 2011.While investigating reports of unlawful weapons trafficking peacekeeping forces encountered an unclassified carnivorous species occupying a small village in Northern Africa. These rabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to conventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the region now referred to as Ground:ALPHA...Only four were successfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were quarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims displayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated necrosis similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses native to that region.But it wasnt a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens.These parasites we call them Alpha-worms laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However unlike most genetic failures these symptoms were not fatal. Instead infested victims were larger stronger... and driven by hunger. Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years but elite squad quickly put them down.

1028,AI War: Fleet Command,You are outgunned. You are massively outnumbered. You must win. These are your orders.Humanity has already fought its war against the machines -- and lost. AI death squads stand watch over every planet and every wormhole the few remaining human settlements are held captive in orbiting bubbles and the AIs have turned their attention outward away from the galaxy to alien threats or opportunities unknown.This inattention is our only hope: a small resistance too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until its too late.You do have a few things going in your favor. Your ships are much faster. You have safe AI routines to automate defenses and mining outposts. You have production techniques that can churn out fully-outfitted unmanned fighters in seconds. There will never be more than a few thousand of your ships versus tens of thousands of theirs but through careful strategy you must somehow reach and destroy the heavily-guarded AI cores.Go forth into the galaxy steal AI technology recapture those planets you must in order to achieve your ends and save what remains of humanity. But draw too much attention to yourself and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down.,English**languages with full audio support,Oct 21 2009,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447352539,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/40400/header.jpg?t=1447352539,,http://www.arcengames.com/forums/index.php/board3.0.html,9.99,9.99,0,848,1,1,1
